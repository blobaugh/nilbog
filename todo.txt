Result messages for content edit

on save close window and refresh affected div

**** KNOWN BUGS ****


FUTURE WORK
create mount points in page tree. users will be given a mount point and can edit anything under that point
create hooks similar to wordpress. eg, on login, on logout, on content save, on content load, on display, etc 
allow multiple templates to be packaged as themes a user can choose from
use as a service. site simply uploads their design somewhere(anywhere) and includes the required nilbog js files. possibly allow some layout design like stiqr
use services such as rpc.pingomatic.com for content aggregation
clicking edit changes the div to an editor instead of opening a new window




**** ISSUES I RAN INTO ****
json requests returning null. fixed by not relying on builtin functions. built my own. see nilbog/js/login.js



**** SECURITY CONCERN ****
malicious user changes javascript login script to return a valid login. this is ok because the server ALSO has to setup a USER session in order for the login to be valid
