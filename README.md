nilbog
======
nilbog was a front end based CMS that I originally wrote to go along with my senior thesis. It combined features of several existing powerful content management systems together into what became known as nilbog. All content managment was done from the frontend of the site, with no backend existing at all. User's updated content by clicking inside divs marked by the themer as editable. New pages and plugins could be added from the admin toolbar which showed along the top of the screen when the user logged in. 

This project is no longer worked on and it kept around for posterity only. There are some great coding concepts here so feel free to play with it. Unfortunately I found the code many years after college and do not have a copy of the database structure to go along with it. Maybe someday I will get back to this CMS and sort it all out, but that is unlikely
